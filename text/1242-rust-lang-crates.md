- Rust Issue: N/A

# Summary

This RFC proposes a policy around the crates under the rust-lang github
organization that are not part of the Rust distribution (compiler or standard
library). At a high level, it proposes that these crates be:

- Governed similarly to the standard library;
- Maintained at a similar level to the standard library, including platform support;
- Carefully curated for quality.

# Motivation

There are three main motivations behind this RFC.

**Keeping `std` small**. There is a widespread desire to keep the standard
  library reasonably small, and for good reason: the stability promises made in
  `std` are tied to the versioning of Rust itself, as are updates to it, meaning
  that the standard library has much less flexibility than other crates
  enjoy. While we *do* plan to continue to grow `std`, and there are legitimate
  reasons for APIs to live there, we still plan to take a minimalistic
  approach. See
  [this discussion](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/what-should-go-into-the-standard-library/2158)
  for more details.

The desire to keep `std` small is in tension with the desire to provide
high-quality libraries *that belong to the whole Rust community* and cover a
wider range of functionality. The poster child here is the
[regex crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex), which provides vital
functionality but is not part of the standard library or basic Rust distribution
-- and which is, in principle, under the control of the whole Rust community.

This RFC resolves the tension between a "batteries included" Rust and a small
`std` by treating `rust-lang` crates as, in some sense, "the rest of the
standard library". While this doesn't solve the entire problem of curating the
library ecosystem, it offers a big step for some of the most significant/core
functionality we want to commit to.

**Staging `std`**. For cases where we do want to grow the standard library, we
  of course want to heavily vet APIs before their stabilization. Historically
  we've done so by landing the APIs directly in `std`, but marked unstable,
  relegating their use to nightly Rust. But in many cases, new `std` APIs can
  just as well begin their life as external crates, usable on stable Rust, and
  ultimately stabilized wholesale. The recent
  [`std::net` RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1158) is a good
  example of this phenomenon.

The main challenge to making this kind of "`std` staging" work is getting
sufficient visibility, central management, and community buy-in for the library
prior to stabilization. When there is widespread desire to extend `std` in a
certain way, this RFC proposes that the extension can start its life as an
external rust-lang crate (ideally usable by stable Rust). It also proposes an
eventual migration path into `std`.

**Cleanup**. During the stabilization of `std`, a fair amount of functionality
   was moved out into external crates hosted under the rust-lang github
   organization. The quality and future prospects of these crates varies widely,
   and we would like to begin to organize and clean them up.

# Detailed design

## The lifecycle of a rust-lang crate

First, two additional github organizations are proposed:

- rust-lang-nursery
- rust-lang-deprecated

New cratess start their life in a `0.X` series that lives in the
rust-lang-nursery. Crates in this state do not represent a major commitment from
the Rust maintainers; rather, they signal a trial period. A crate enters the
nursery when (1) there is already a working body of code and (2) the library
subteam approves a petition for inclusion. The petition is informal (not an
RFC), and can take the form of a discuss post laying out the motivation and
perhaps some high-level design principles, and linking to the working code.

If the library team accepts a crate into the nursery, they are indicating an
*interest* in ultimately advertising the crate as "a core part of Rust", and in
maintaining the crate permanently. During the 0.X series in the nursery, the
original crate author maintains control of the crate, approving PRs and so on,
but the library subteam and broader community is expected to participate.  As
we'll see below, nursery crates will be advertised (though not in the same way
as full rust-lang crates), increasing the chances that the crate is scrutinized
before being promoted to the next stage.

Eventually, a nursery crate will either fail (and move to rust-lang-deprecated)
or reach a point where a 1.0 release would be appropriate. The failure case
will be determined by means of an RFC.

If, on the other hand, a library reaches the 1.0 point, it is ready to be
promoted into rust-lang proper. To do so, an RFC must be written outlining the
motivation for the crate, the reasons that community ownership are important,
and delving into the API design and its rationale design. These RFCs are
intended to follow similar lines to the pre-1.0 stabilization RFCs for the
standard library (such as
[collections](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/235) or
[Duration](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1040)) -- which have been very
successful in improving API design prior to stabilization. Once a "1.0 RFC" is
approved by the libs team, the crate moves into the rust-lang organization, and
is henceforth governed by the whole Rust community. That means in particular
that significant changes (certainly those that would require a major version
bump, but other substantial PRs as well) are reviewed by the library subteam and
may require an RFC. On the other hand, the community has broadly agreed to
maintain the library in perpetuity (unless it is later deprecated). And again,
as we'll see below, the promoted crate is very visibly advertised as part of the
"core Rust" package.

Promotion to 1.0 requires first-class support on all first-tier platforms,
except for platform-specific libraries.

Crates in rust-lang may issue new major versions, just like any other crates,
though such changes should go through the RFC process. While the library subteam
is responsible for major decisions about the library after 1.0, its original
author(s) will of course wield a great deal of influence, and their objections
will be given due weight in the consensus process.

### Relation to `std`

In many cases, the above description of the crate lifecycle is complete. But
some rust-lang crates are destined for std. Usually this will be clear up front.

When a std-destined crate has reached sufficient maturity, the libs subteam can
call a "final comment period" for moving it into `std` proper. Assuming there
are no blocking objections, the code is moved into `std`, and the original repo
is left intact, with the following changes:

- a minor version bump,
- *conditionally* replacing all definitions with `pub use` from `std` (which
  will require the ability to `cfg` switch on feature/API availability -- a
  highly-desired feature on its own).

By re-routing the library to `std` when available we provide seamless
compatibility between users of the library externally and in `std`. In
particular, traits and types defined in the crate are compatible across either
way of importing them.

### Deprecation

At some point a library may become stale -- either because it failed to make it
out of the nursery, or else because it was supplanted by a superior library.
Nursery and rust-lang crates can be deprecated only through an RFC. This is
expected to be a rare occurrence.

Deprecated crates move to rust-lang-deprecated and are subsequently minimally
maintained. For crates that are popular in the ecosystem (defined as at least
50,000 crates.io downloads in the last 90 days), minimal maintenance includes
merging and publishing reasonable bug fixes and platform support for platforms
that are at least tier 3.

Alternatively, if someone volunteers to maintain the crate,
ownership can be transferred externally.

## Advertising

Part of the reason for having rust-lang crates is to have a clear, short list of
libraries that are broadly useful, vetted and maintained. But where should this
list appear?

This RFC doesn't specify the complete details, but proposes a basic direction:

- The crates in rust-lang should appear in the sidebar in the core rustdocs
  distributed with Rust, along side the standard library. (For nightly releases,
  we should include the nursery crates as well.)

- The crates should also be published on crates.io, and should somehow be
*badged*. But the design of a badging/curation system for crates.io is out of
scope for this RFC.

## Plan for existing crates

There are already a number of non-`std` crates in rust-lang. Below, we give the
full list along with recommended actions:

### Transfer ownership

Please volunteer if you're interested in taking one of these on!

- rlibc
- semver
- threadpool

### Move to rust-lang-nursery

- bitflags
- getopts
- glob
- libc
- log
- rand (note, @huonw has a major revamp in the works)
- regex
- rustc-serialize (but will likely be replaced by serde or other approach eventually)
- tempdir (destined for `std` after reworking)
- uuid

### Move to rust-lang-deprecated

- fourcc: highly niche
- hexfloat: niche
- num: this is essentially a dumping ground from 1.0 stabilization; needs a complete re-think.
- term: API needs total overhaul
- time: needs total overhaul destined for std
- url: replaced by https://github.com/servo/rust-url

# Drawbacks

The drawbacks of this RFC are largely social:

* Emphasizing rust-lang crates may alienate some in the Rust community, since it
  means that certain libraries obtain a special "blessing". This is mitigated by
  the fact that these libraries also become owned by the community at large.

* On the other hand, requiring that ownership/governance be transferred to the
  library subteam may be a disincentive for library authors, since they lose
  unilateral control of their libraries. But this is an inherent aspect of the
  policy design, and the vastly increased visibility of libraries is likely a
  strong enough incentive to overcome this downside.

# Alternatives

The main alternative would be to not maintain other crates under the rust-lang
umbrella, and to offer some other means of curation (the latter of which is
needed in any case).

That would be a missed opportunity, however; Rust's governance and maintenance
model has been very successful so far, and given our minimalistic plans for the
standard library, it is very appealing to have *some* other way to apply the
full Rust community in taking care of additional crates.

# Unresolved questions

Part of the maintenance standard for Rust is the CI infrastructure, including
bors/homu. What level of CI should we provide for these crates, and how do we do it?

- Feature Name: `trait_alias_impl`
- Start Date: 2023-05-24
- RFC PR: [rust-lang/rfcs#3437](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3437)
- Rust Issue: [rust-lang/rust#0000](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/0000)

# Summary

Extend `#![feature(trait_alias)]` to permit `impl` blocks for trait aliases with
a single primary trait. Also support fully-qualified method call syntax with
such aliases.

# Motivation

Often, one desires to have a "weak" version of a trait, as well as a "strong"
one providing additional guarantees. Specifically, this RFC addresses trait
relationships with the following properties:

- For any implementation of the "strong" variant, there is exactly one way to
  implement the "weak" variant.
- For any implementation of the "weak" variant, there is at most one way to
  implement the "strong" variant.

Subtrait relationships are commonly used to model this, but this often leads to
coherence and backward compatibility issues.

## AFIT `Send` bound aliases

Imagine a library, `frob-lib`, that provides a trait with an async method.

```rust
//! crate `frob-lib`
pub trait Frob {
    async fn frob(&self);
}
```

Most of `frob-lib`'s users will need `Frob::frob`'s return type to be `Send`, so
the library wants to make this common case as painless as possible. But
non-`Send` usage should be supported as well.

### MVP: `trait_variant`

Because Return Type Notation isn't supported yet, `frob-lib` follows the
recommended practice of using the
[`trait-variant`](https://docs.rs/trait-variant/) crate to have `Send` and
non-`Send` variants.

```rust
//! crate `frob-lib``

#[trait_variant::make(Frob: Send)]
pub trait LocalFrob {
    async fn frob(&mut self);
}
```

However, this API has limitations. Fox example, `frob-lib` may want to offer a
`DoubleFrob` wrapper:

```rust
pub struct DoubleFrob<T: LocalFrob>(T);

impl<T: LocalFrob> LocalFrob for DoubleFrob<T> {
    async fn frob(&mut self) {
        self.0.frob().await;
        self.0.frob().await;
    }
}
```

As written, this wrapper only implements `LocalFrob`, which means that it's not
fully compatible with work-stealing executors. So `frob-lib` tries to add a
`Frob` implementation as well:

```rust
impl<T: Frob> Frob for DoubleFrob<T> {
    async fn frob(&mut self) {
        self.0.frob().await;
        self.0.frob().await;
    }
}
```

Coherence, however, rejects this.

```
error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `LocalFrob` for type `DoubleFrob<_>`
 --> src/lib.rs:1:1
  |
1 | #[trait_variant::make(Frob: Send)]

  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `trait_variant::make` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0119`.
```

With the `trait_variant`-based design, it's impossible to support both `Send`
and non-`Send` usage in the same `DoubleFrob` type.

### Migrating to Return Type Notation

A few Rust releases later, Return Type Notation is stabilized. `frob-lib` wants
to migrate to it in order to address the issues with the `trait_variant`
solution:

```rust
//! crate `frob-lib``

pub trait LocalFrob {
    async fn frob(&self);
}

// or whatever RTN syntax is decided on
pub trait Frob: LocalFrob<frob(..): Send> + Send {}
impl<T: ?Sized> Frob for T where T: LocalFrob<frob(..): Send> + Send {}
```

However, this is an incompatible change; all implementations of `Frob` are
broken!

```rust
//! crate `downstream`
use frob_lib::Frob;

struct MyType;

impl Frob for MyType {
    // Now an error, "trait `Frob` has no method `frob`"
    async fn frob(&self) { /* ... */ }
}
```

All `impl` blocks for `Frob` must be migrated to reference `LocalFrob` instead.

```rust
//! crate `downstream`
use frob_lib::LocalFrob;

struct MyType;

impl LocalFrob for MyType {
    async fn frob(&self) { /* ... */ }
}
```

Not only is this change disruptive, it also results in more confusing code.
`downstream` is written for work-stealing executors, but needs to reference
`LocalFrob` anyway.

### With today's `#![feature(trait_alias)]`

What if `frob-lib` looked like this instead?

```rust
//! crate `frob-lib`
#![feature(trait_alias)]

pub trait LocalFrob {
    async fn frob(&self);
}

pub trait Frob = LocalFrob<frob(..): Send> + Send;
```

With today's `trait_alias`, it wouldn't make much difference for `downstream`.
`impl` blocks for `Frob` would still be broken.

## (Speculative) GATification of `Iterator`

*This example relies on some language features that are currently pure
speculation. Implementable trait aliases are potentially necessary to support
this use-case, but not sufficient.*

Ever since the GAT MVP was stabilized, there has been discussion about how to
add `LendingIterator` to the standard library, without breaking existing uses of
`Iterator`. The relationship between `LendingIterator` and `Iterator` is
"weak"/"strong"; an `Iterator` is a `LendingIterator` with an extra guarantee
about its `Item` associated type (namely, that it is bivariant in its lifetime
parameter).

Now, let's imagine that Rust had some form of "variance bounds", that allowed
restricting the way in which a type's GAT can depend on said GAT's generic
parameters. One could then define `Iterator` in terms of `LendingIterator`, like
so:

```rust
//! `core::iter`
pub trait LendingIterator {
    type Item<'a>
    where
        Self: 'a;

    fn next(&'a mut self) -> Self::Item<'a>;
}

pub trait Iterator = LendingIterator
where
    // speculative syntax, just for the sake of this example
    for<'a> Self::Item<'a>: bivariant_in<'a>;
```

But, as with the previous example, we are foiled by the fact that trait aliases
aren't `impl`ementable, so this change would break every `impl Iterator` block
in existence.

## (Speculative) `Async` trait

There has been some discussion about a variant of the `Future` trait with an
`unsafe` poll method, to support structured concurrency ([wg-async design
notes](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-async/vision/roadmap/scopes/capability/variant_async_trait.html)).
*If* such a change ever happens, then the same "weak"/"strong" relationship will
arise: the safe-to-poll `Future` trait would be a "strong" version of the
unsafe-to-poll `Async`. As the linked design notes explain, there are major
problems with expressing that relationship in today's Rust.

# Guide-level explanation

With `#![feature(trait_alias)]` (RFC #1733), one can define trait aliases, for
use in bounds, trait objects, and `impl Trait`. This feature additionally allows
writing `impl` blocks for a subset of trait aliases.

Let's rewrite our AFIT example from before using this feature. Here's what it
looks like now:

```rust
//! crate `frob-lib`
#![feature(trait_alias)]

pub trait LocalFrob {
    async fn frob(&self);
}

pub trait Frob = LocalFrob<frob(..): Send> 
where
    // not `+ Send`!
    Self: Send;
```

```rust
//! crate `downstream`
#![feature(trait_alias_impl)]

use frob_lib::Frob;

struct MyType;

impl Frob for MyType {
    async fn frob(&self) { /* ... */ }
}
```

`impl`s of `Frob` now Just Work.

The rule of thumb is: if you can copy everything between the `=` and `;` of a
trait alias, paste it between the `for` and `{` of a trait `impl` block, and the
result is syntactically valid—then the trait alias is implementable.

# Reference-level explanation

## Implementability rules

A trait alias has the following syntax (using the Rust Reference's notation):

> [Visibility](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html)<sup>?</sup>
> `trait`
> [IDENTIFIER](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/identifiers.html)
> [GenericParams](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/generics.html)<sup>?</sup>
> `=`
> [TypeParamBounds](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/trait-bounds.html)<sup>?</sup>
> [WhereClause](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/generics.html#where-clauses)<sup>?</sup>
> `;`

For example, `trait Foo<T> = PartialEq<T> + Send where Self: Sync;` is a valid
trait alias.

Implementable trait aliases must follow a more restrictive form:

> [Visibility](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html)<sup>?</sup>
> `trait`
> [IDENTIFIER](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/identifiers.html)
> [GenericParams](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/generics.html)<sup>?</sup>
> `=`
> [TypePath](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/paths.html#paths-in-types)
> [WhereClause](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/generics.html#where-clauses)<sup>?</sup>
> `;`

For example, `trait Foo<T> = PartialEq<T> where Self: Sync;` is a valid
implementable alias. The `=` must be followed by a single trait (or
implementable trait alias), and then some number of where clauses. The trait's
generic parameter list may contain associated type constraints (for example
`trait IntIterator = Iterator<Item = u32>`).

## Usage in `impl` blocks

An `impl` block for a trait alias looks just like an `impl` block for the
underlying trait. The alias's where clauses are enforced as requirements that
the `impl`ing type must meet—just like `where` clauses in trait declarations are
treated.

```rust
pub trait CopyIterator = Iterator<Item: Copy> where Self: Send;

struct Foo;

impl CopyIterator for Foo {
    type Item = i32; // Would be an error if this was `String`

    fn next(&mut self) -> Self::Item {
        42
    }
}

struct Bar;
impl !Send for Bar;

//impl CopyIterator for Bar { /* ... */ } // ERROR: `Bar` is not `Send`
```

```rust
trait Foo {}
trait Bar = Foo where Self: Send;
//impl<T> Bar for T {} // ERROR: Need to add `T: Send` bound
```

```rust
#![feature(trivial_bounds)]
trait Foo {}
trait Bar = Foo where String: Copy;
//impl Bar for () {} // ERROR: `String: Copy` not satisfied
```

Bounds on generic parameters are also enforced at the `impl` site.

```rust
trait Underlying<T> {}

trait Alias<T: Send> = Underlying<T>;

impl Alias<*const i32> for i32 {} // Error: `*const i32` is not `Send`
```

If the trait alias uniquely constrains a portion of the `impl` block, that part
can be omitted.

```rust
pub trait IntIterator = Iterator<Item = i32> where Self: Send;

struct Baz;

impl IntIterator for Baz {
    // The alias constrains `Self::Item` to `i32`, so we don't need to specify it
    // (though we are allowed to do so if desired).

    fn next(&mut self) -> i32 {
        -27
    }
}
```

Such constraints can be inferred indirectly:

```rust
trait Bar: Iterator<Item = i32> {}
pub trait IntIterator = Iterator where Self: Bar;

struct Baz;

impl Bar for Baz {}

impl IntIterator for Baz {
    // `IntIterator` requires `Bar`,
    // which requires `Iterator<Item = i32>`,
    // so `Item` must be `i32`
    // and we don't need to specify it.

    fn next(&mut self) -> i32 {
        -27
    }
}
```

Alias `impl`s also allow omitting implied `#[refine]`s:

```rust
//! crate frob-lib
#![feature(trait_alias)]

pub trait LocalFrob {
    async fn frob(&self);
}

// not `+ Send`!
pub trait Frob = LocalFrob<frob(..): Send> where Self: Send;
```

```rust
//! crate joes-crate
#![feature(trait_alias_impl)]

use frob_lib::Frob;

struct MyType;

impl Frob for MyType {
    // The return future of this method is implicitly `Send`, as implied by the alias.
    // No `#[refine]` is necessary.
    async fn frob(&self) { /* ... */ }
}
```

Trait aliases are `unsafe` to implement iff the underlying trait is marked
`unsafe`.

## Usage in paths

Implementable trait aliases can also be used with trait-qualified and
fully-qualified method call syntax, as well as in paths more generally. When
used this way, they are treated equivalently to the underlying primary trait,
with the additional restriction that all `where` clauses and type
parameter/associated type bounds must be satisfied.

```rust
use std::array;

trait IntIter = Iterator<Item = u32> where Self: Clone;

let iter = [1_u32].into_iter();
let _: IntIter::Item = IntIter::next(&mut iter); // works
let _: <array::IntoIter as IntIter>::Item = <array::IntoIter as IntIter>::next(); // works
//IntIter::clone(&iter); // ERROR: trait `Iterator` has no method named `clone()`
let dyn_iter: &mut dyn Iterator<Item = u32> = &mut iter;
//IntIter::next(dyn_iter); // ERROR: `dyn Iterator<Item = u32>` does not implement `Clone`
let signed_iter = [1_i32].into_iter();
//IntIter::next(&mut signed_iter); // ERROR: Expected `<Self as Iterator>::Item` to be `u32`, it is `i32`
```

Implementable trait aliases can also be used with associated type bounds; the
associated type must belong to the alias's primary trait.

```rust
trait IteratorAlias = Iterator;
let _: IteratorAlias<Item = u32> = [1_u32].into_iter();

trait IntIter = Iterator<Item = u32> where Self: Clone;
let _: IntIter<Item = u32> = [1_u32].into_iter(); // `Item = u32` is redundant, but allowed
//let _: IntIter<Item = f64> = [1.0_f64].into_iter(); // ERROR: `Item = f64` conflicts with `Item = u32`
```

# Drawbacks

- The syntactic distance between implementable and non-implementable aliases is
  short, which might confuse users. In particular, the fact that `trait Foo =
  Bar + Send;` means something different than `trait Foo = Bar where Self:
  Send;` will likely be surprising to many.
- Adds complexity to the language, which might surprise or confuse users.
- Many of the motivating use-cases involve language features that are not yet
  stable, or even merely speculative. More experience with those features might
  unearth better alternatives.

# Rationale and alternatives

- Very lightweight, with no new syntax forms. Compare "trait transformers"
  proposals, for example—they are generally much heavier.
  - However, trait transformers would also address more use-cases (for example,
    sync and async versions of a trait).
- Better ergonomics compared to purely proc-macro based solutions.
- One alternative is to allow marker traits or auto traits to appear in `+`
  bounds of implementable aliases. (For example, `trait Foo = Bar + Send;` could
  be made implementable).
  - This may make the implementablility rules more intuitive to some, as the
    distinction between `+ Send` and `where Self: Send` would no longer be
    present.
  - However, it also might make the rules less intuitive, as the symmetry with
    `impl` blocks would be broken.
  - Also, such a change might break the commutativity of `+`.
  - It could also make it less obvious which trait is being implemented, versus
    required; are we implementing `Bar`, `Send`, or both?
  - Again, user feedback could help make this decision.
- Another option is to require an attribute on implementable aliases; e.g.
  `#[implementable] trait Foo = ...`. This would make the otherwise-subtle
  implementability rules more explicit, at the cost of cluttering user code and
  the attribute namespace.
- A previous version of this RFC required generic parameters of implementable
  trait aliases to be used as generic parameters of the alias's primary trait.
  This restriction was meant to avoid surprising errors:

```rust
trait Foo<T> = Copy;

#[derive(Clone)]
struct MyType;

impl<T> Foo<T> for MyType {} // ERROR: `T`` is unconstrained
```

```rust
trait Foo<T> = Iterator<Item = T>;

struct MyType;

impl Foo<u32> for MyType {
    fn next(&mut Self) -> Option<u32> {
        todo!()
    }
}

impl Foo<i32> for MyType { // ERROR: overlapping impls
    fn next(&mut Self) -> Option<i32> {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

However, upon further discussion, I now lean toward allowing more flexibility,
even at the risk of potential confusion.

# Prior art

- [`trait_transformer` macro](https://github.com/google/impl_trait_utils)

# Unresolved questions

- How does `rustdoc` render these? Consider the `Frob` example—ideally, `Frob`
  should be emphasized compared to `LocalFrob`, but it's not clear how that
  would work.

# Future possibilities

- New kinds of bounds: anything that makes `where` clauses more powerful would
  make this feature more powerful as well.
  - Variance bounds would allow this feature to support backward-compatible
    GATification.
  - Method unsafety bounds would support the `Future` → `Async` use-case.
- `trait Foo: Copy = Iterator;` could be allowed as an alternative syntax to
  `trait Foo = Iterator where Self: Copy;`.
- `impl Trait<Assoc = Ty> for Type { /* ... */ }` could be permitted in the
  future, to make the "copy-paste" rule of thumb work better.

## Combining multiple primary traits into one `impl` block

As an extension of this proposal, Rust could allows trait aliases to be
implementable even if they have multiple primary traits. For example:

```rust
trait Foo = Clone + PartialEq;

struct Stu;

impl Foo for Stu {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        Stu
    }

    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

Such a feature could be useful when a trait has multiple items and you want to
split it in two.

However, there are some issues to resolve. Most glaring is the risk of name
collisions:

```rust
trait A {
    fn foo();
}

trait B {
    fn foo();
}

// How would you write an `impl` block for this?
trait C = A + B;
```

Such a feature could also make it harder to find the declaration of a trait item
from its implementation, especially if IDE "go to definition" is not available.
One would need to first find the trait alias definition, and then look through
every primary trait to find the item. (However, given the current situation with
postfix method call syntax, maybe this is an acceptable trade-off.)

Perhaps a more narrowly tailored version of this extension, in which both
subtrait and supertrait explicitly opt-in to support sharing an `impl` block
with one another, would satisfy the backward-compatibility use-case while
avoiding the above issues. Alternatively, there could be an explictit syntax for
disambiguating within the `impl` block which trait an item comes from.

## Associated items in trait aliases

Trait aliases could be expanded to support associated types and consts[^1] that
are uniquely constrained by the associated items of the underlying trait and
where clauses. For example, imagine that `foolib v1.0` defines a trait like the
following:

[^1]: Supporting associated methods (with non-overridable defaults) is also a
possibility. However, extension traits already address all potential use-cases
of that feature (as far as I can see).

```rust
//! foolib 1.0

pub trait Frobnicate {
    type Item;

    frob(&self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

Later on, `foolib`'s developers realize that many users want their `frob()`
implementation to return something other than `Option` (`Result`, for example).
With trait alias associated types, this could be done backward-compatibly and
with no coherence issues:

```rust
//! foolib 1.1

pub trait FlexibleFrobnicate {
    type Output;

    frob(&self) -> Self::Output;
}

pub trait Frobnicate = FlexibleFrobnicate<Output = Option<Self::Item>> {
    type Item;
}
```

`impl` blocks should be allowed to omit associated items that are "uniquely
constrained" by other such items. Such a capability would be useful even outside
the context of trait aliases, for example when implementing `IntoIterator`:

```rust
struct Iter;

impl Iterator for Iter {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<u32> {
        Some(42)
    }
}

struct IntoIter;

impl IntoIterator for IntoIter {
    type IntoIter = Iter;

    // `type Item` is uniquely constrained by `Self::IntoIter`,
    // so it could be omitted.

    fn into_iter(self) -> Iter {
        Iter
    }
}
```

### Trait aliases constrained by their associated items

If trait aliases with associated items are additionally allowed to refer to
those items from the definition of the alias itself, it would be possible to
express certain kinds of trait bounds that current `where` clauses do not
support.

For example:

```rust
/// An `Iterator` that yields `Result`s.
trait ResultIterator = Iterator<Item = Result<Self::Ok, Self::Err>> {
    type Ok;
    type Err;
}
```

In the context of the above example, a `T: ResultIterator` bound would mean
"there exist unique types `Ok` and `Err` such that `T: Iterator<Item =
Result<Ok, Err>>` holds". Current Rust provides no mechanism for expressing a
bound like that; you need a separate trait, like
[`TryFuture`](https://docs.rs/futures-core/latest/futures_core/future/trait.TryFuture.html).

This feature could even allow GATification of `Iterator` (or `FnMut`, etc)
without variance bounds:

```rust
pub trait LendingIterator {
    type LentItem<'a>
    where
        Self: 'a;

    fn next<'a>(&'a mut self) -> Option<Self::LentItem<'a>>;
}

// `T: Iterator` means
// "there exists a unique type `Item` such that
// `T: LendingIterator where for<'a> Self::LentItem<'a> = Item`"
// (which holds iff `Self::LentItem<'a>` is bivariant in `'a`).
pub trait Iterator = LendingIterator
where
    // Still need to solve implied `'static` bound problem
    // (https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization.html#implied-static-requirement-from-higher-ranked-trait-bounds)
    for<'a> Self::LentItem<'a> = Self::Item,
{
    type Item;
}
```

### Name conflicts

One wrinkle with the above scheme, is that it is possible for the trait being
aliased to define, in a new minor version, additional trait items that have the
same name as associated items of the alias itself.

```rust
//! foolib
#![feature(associated_type_defaults)]

pub trait Foo {
    type Assoc;
    /// Added in v1.1
    type WrappedAssoc = Result<Self::Assoc, ()>;
}
```

```rust
//! aliaslib
extern crate foolib;

pub trait Alias = foolib::Foo {
    /// Added in v1.1
    type WrappedAssoc = Option<Self::Assoc>;
}
```

```rust
//! thirdlib
extern crate foolib;
extern crate aliaslib;

impl Alias for Bar {
    // What does this do?
    // The issues here are similar to those for combining multiple traits
    // in the same `impl` block.
    type WrappedAssoc = Option<()>;
}
```

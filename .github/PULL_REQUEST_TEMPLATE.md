<!-- Thank you for trying to improve Rust through the RFC process! -->
<!-- Please add a short summary of your RFC below -->

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When responding to RFCs, try to use inline review comments (it is possible to leave an inline review comment for the entire file at the top) instead of direct comments for normal comments and keep normal comments for procedural matters like starting FCPs.
